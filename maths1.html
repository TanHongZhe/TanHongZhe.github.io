                <br>Introduction: <br> Prime numbers, the building blocks of natural numbers founded by Greek mathematician Euclid of Alexandria, at around 300 B.C., have captivated mathematicians for centuries. Beyond their applications in cryptography, prime numbers exhibit intriguing connections to other fields of study, including mathematics and physics. In this page, we delve into the depths of mathematics to explore how prime numbers are intertwined with various mathematical concepts. Additionally, we uncover the surprising link between prime numbers and physics, where they find unexpected applications and shed light on fundamental phenomena. 
                <br><br> Prime Numbers in Mathematics: <br>
                Prime numbers form the foundation of number theory, a branch of mathematics dedicated to studying the properties and relationships of numbers. Mathematicians have long been captivated by prime numbers due to their unique characteristics. Prime numbers are at the core of modular arithmetic, playing a pivotal role in solving equations and understanding patterns in number sequences. Concepts such as greatest common divisors and least common multiples heavily rely on prime factorization, allowing mathematicians to solve complex problems involving fractions, algebraic equations, and more. 
                The study of prime numbers has given rise to groundbreaking theorems and conjectures. Mathematicians continue to explore the depths of prime number theory, unraveling patterns, and uncovering new connections with other mathematical concepts. Prime numbers also find significance in the investigation of unsolved mathematical problems, offering valuable insights into challenges such as the Riemann Hypothesis, Twin Prime Conjecture, Goldbach's Conjecture, and the Collatz Conjecture. The pursuit of these problems drives mathematical research forward and sheds light on the elusive nature of prime numbers.
